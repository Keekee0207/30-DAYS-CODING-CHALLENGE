DAY 11:
PROBLEM 1:
Kitchen Timings
The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from X pm to Y pm (1≤X<Y≤12).

Find the number of hours Chef works.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.

CODE:
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    print(Y-X)

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 2
3 7
9 11
2 10
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
4
2
8

PROBLEM 2:
Greater Average
You are given 3 numbers A,B, and C.

Determine whether the average of A and B is strictly greater than C or not?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of 3 integers A,B, and C.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if average of A and B is strictly greater than C, NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    A,B,C=map(int,input().split())
    if((A+B)/2)>C:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print('NO')
SAMPLE INPUT:
5
5 9 6
5 8 6
5 7 6
4 9 8
3 7 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
YES
YES
NO
