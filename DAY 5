DAY 5:
PROBLEM 1:
Waiting Time
Chef is eagerly waiting for a piece of information. His secret agent told him that this information would be revealed to him after K weeks.
X days have already passed and Chef is getting restless now. Find the number of remaining days Chef has to wait for, to get the information.
It is guaranteed that the information has not been revealed to the Chef yet.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of 
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers K and X, as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of remaining days that Chef will have to wait for.

Constraints
1≤T≤500
1≤K≤10
1≤X<7⋅K

CODE:

T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    K,X=map(int,input().split())
    print((K*7)-X)

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
1 5
1 6
1 1
1 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2
1
6
5

PROBLEM 2:
Count the Notebooks
You know that 1 kg of pulp can be used to make 1000 pages and 1 notebook consists of 100 pages.

Suppose a notebook factory receives N kg of pulp, how many notebooks can be made from that?

Input Format
First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer N - the weight of the pulp the factory has (in kgs).

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of notebooks that can be made using N kgs of pulp.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100

CODE:

T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    print(N*10)

SAMPLE INPUT:
3
1
100
50

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
10
1000
500
