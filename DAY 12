DAY 12:
PROBLEM 1:
Messi vs Ronaldo
In Chefland, a football player gets 2 points for each goal and 1 point for each assist.

Messi has A goals and B assists this season, whereas Ronaldo has X goals and Y assists.
Find out the player with more points this season.

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contains four space-separated integers A, B, X and Y, the number of goals and assists that Messi has and the number of goals and assists that Ronaldo has, respectively.
Output Format
Print a single line containing:

Messi, if Messi has more points than Ronaldo.
Ronaldo, if Ronaldo has more points than Messi.
Equal, if both have equal points.

CODE:
A,B,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
messi=(A*2)+B
ronaldo=(X*2)+Y
if(messi>ronaldo):
    
    print("messi")
elif(messi==ronaldo):
    print("equal")
        
else:
    print("ronaldo")

SAMPLE INPUT:
40 30 50 10
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Equal

PROBLEM 2:
Single-use Attack
Chef is playing a video game, and is now fighting the final boss.

The boss has H health points. Each attack of Chef reduces the health of the boss by X.
Chef also has a special attack that can be used at most once, and will decrease the health of the boss by Y.

Chef wins when the health of the boss is ≤0.
What is the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case will contain three space-separated integers H,X,Y — the parameters described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    H,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    attack=0
    H=H-Y
    attack+=1
    while(H>0):
        H=H-X
        attack+=1
    print(attack)

SAMPLE INPUT:
