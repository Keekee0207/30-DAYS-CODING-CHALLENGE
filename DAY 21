DAY 21
  PROBLEM 1
  Masterchef finals
Chef has been working hard to compete in MasterChef.
He is ranked X out of all contestants. However, only 10 contestants would be selected for the finals.

Check whether Chef made it to the top 10 or not?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integers X â€” the current rank of Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef made it to the top 10 and NO otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>10):
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes")

  PROBLEM 2
  Bath in Winters
A geyser has a capacity of 
X
X litres of water and a bucket has a capacity of 
Y
Y litres of water.

One person requires exactly 
2
2 buckets of water to take a bath. Find the maximum number of people that can take bath using water from one completely filled geyser..

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers X,Y.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of people that can take bath.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    per=Y*2
    total=X//per
    print(total)
