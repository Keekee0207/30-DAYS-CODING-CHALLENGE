DAY 4
PROBLEM 1:
Fever
Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a thermometer and it came out to be X °F.

A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is strictly greater than 98 °F.

Determine if Chef has fever or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer X - the body temperature of Chef in °F.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef has fever. Otherwise, output NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤10
94≤X≤103

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>98):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
SAMPLE INPUT:
3
98
100
96

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
NO
YES
NO

PROBLEM 2:
Bus Seat Numbering
There is a bus with 30 seats. The seats are numbered from 1 to 30, and the numbering is as depicted in this image.

As can be seen in the image, the bus is divided into two decks - The Lower deck, and the Upper deck, with 15 seats each. And some of the seats come as Single and some as Double. For example, Seats 1 and 2 are Double, whereas Seat 11 is a Single.

You will be given a Seat number, and your job is to classify it as one of these 4 types:

Lower Single
Lower Double
Upper Single
Upper Double
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input which contains a single integers N — the seat number.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the type of seat.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤30

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    if(N<=15):
        if(N<=10):
            print("Lower Double")
        else:
            print("Lower Single")
    else:
        if(N<=25):
            print("Upper Double")
        else:
            print("Upper Single")
SAMPLE INPUT:
5
6
28
16
13
10
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Lower Double
Upper Single
Upper Double
Lower Single
Lower Double
