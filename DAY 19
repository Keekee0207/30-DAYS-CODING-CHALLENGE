DAY 19 
PROBLEM 1
Netflix
Alice, Bob, and Charlie are contributing to buy a Netflix subscription. However, Netfix allows only two users to share a subscription.

Given that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have A,B, and C rupees respectively and a Netflix subscription costs X rupees, find whether any two of them can contribute to buy a subscription.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains four space-separated integers A,B,C, and X â€” the amount that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have, and the cost of a Netflix subscription respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES, if any two of Alice, Bob, and Charlie can contribute to buy a Netflix subscription or NO otherwise.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, NO, no, No, and nO are all considered identical.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    A,B,C,X=map(int,input().split())
    if(A+B>=X or B+C>=X or A+C>=X):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
PROBLEM 2
Exams
In Chefland, there are X schools, and each school has Y students.
The year end results are in and a total of Z students passed the exams.

Assuming that all students appeared for the exams, find whether the number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 50%.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X,Y, and Z, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the total number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 50%, otherwise print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())
    total=X*Y 
    if((Z/total)*100 <=50):
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
