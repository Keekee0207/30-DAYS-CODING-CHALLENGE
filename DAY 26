DAY 26
PROBLEM 1
Codechef Airlines
Chef has opened a new airline. Chef has 10 airplanes where each airplane has a capacity of X passengers.
On the first day itself, Y people are willing to book a seat in any one of Chef's airplanes.

Given that Chef charges Z rupees for each ticket, find the maximum amount he can earn on the first day.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X,Y, and Z â€” the capacity of each airplane, the number of people willing to book a seat in any one of Chef's airplanes on the first day, and the cost of each seat respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum amount Chef can earn on the first day.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())
    totalseats=X*10;
    if(Y<=totalseats):
        print(Y*Z)
    else:
        print(totalseats*Z)
  PROBLEM 2
Get Lowest Free
Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. Luckily there's a sale going on under which Chef gets the following offer:

If Chef buys 3 items then he gets the item (out of those 3 items) having the lowest price as free.
For e.g. if Chef bought 3 items with the cost 6, 2 and 4, then he would get the item with cost 2 as free. So he would only have to pay the cost of the other two items which will be 6+4=10.

Chef buys 3 items having prices A, B and C respectively. What is the amount of money Chef needs to pay?

Input Format
The first line will contain an integer T - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers A,B,C - the prices of the items bought by Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output the price paid by Chef.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    list1=list(map(int,input().split()))
    minimum=min(list1)

    list1.remove(minimum)
    print(sum(list1))
