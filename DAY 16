DAY 16
PROBLEM 1
October Marathon
Chef organised a 30 kilometres marathon in Chefland.
The participants receive medals on completing the marathon as following:

If the total time taken is less than 3 hours, they receive a GOLD medal.
If the total time taken is greater than equal t 3 hours but less than 6 hours, they receive a SILVER medal.
If the total time taken is greater than equal to 6 hours, they receive a BRONZE medal.
Chefina participated in the marathon and completed it in X hours. Which medal would she receive?

Input Format
The input consists of a single integer X — the number of hours Chefina took to complete the marathon.
Output Format
Output the medal Chefina would recieve.

SOLUTION
X=int(input())
if(X<3):
    print("GOLD")
elif(X>=3 and X<6):
    print("SILVER")
else:
    print("BRONZE")
PROBLEM 2

Minimum number of Flips
Chef has an array A of length N consisting of 1 and −1 only.


Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array equal to 0. Output -1 if the sum of the array cannot be made 0.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer N denoting the length of the array.
Second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make the sum of the array equal to 0. Output -1 if it is not possible to make the sum equal to 0.

SOLUTION:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    A=list(map(int,input().split()))
    one=A.count(1)
    minus=A.count(-1)
    if(N%2!=0):
        print('-1')
    else:
        print(abs((one-minus)//2))
