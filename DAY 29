DAY 29
PROBLEM 1
Puzzle Hunt
Chef and some of his friends are planning to participate in a puzzle hunt event.

The rules of the puzzle hunt state:
"This hunt is intended for teams of 6 to 8 people."

Chef's team has N people in total. Are they eligible to participate?

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain a single integer N: the number of people present in Chef's team.

Output Format
Print the answer: Yes if Chef's team is eligible to participate, and No otherwise.

Each letter in the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the outputs NO, No, nO, no will all be treated as equivalent.
SOLUTION
N=int(input())
if(N>=6 and N<=8):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
PROBLEM 2
Nearest Exit
There are two exits in a bus with 100 seats:

First exit is located beside seat number 1.
Second exit is located beside seat number 100.
Seats are arranged in a straight line from 1 to 100 with equal spacing between any 2 adjacent seats.

A passenger prefers to choose the nearest exit while leaving the bus.

Determine the exit taken by passenger sitting on seat X.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists a single integer X, denoting the seat number.
Output Format
For each test case, output LEFT if the passenger chooses the exit beside seat 1, RIGHT otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings LEFT, lEft, left, and lEFT will all be treated as identical).
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X<=50):
        print("LEFT")
    else:
        print("Right")
