DAY 10
PROBLEM 1:
each the Target
There is a cricket match going on between two teams A and B.

Team B is batting second and got a target of X runs. Currently, team B has scored Y runs. Determine how many more runs Team B should score to win the match.
Note: The target score in cricket matches is one more than the number of runs scored by the team that batted first.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y, the target for team B and the current score of team B respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output how many more runs team B should score to win the match.

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    print(X-Y)

SAMPLE INPUT:

200 50
100 99
130 97
53 51
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

PROBLEM 2:
Janmansh and Assignments
Janmansh has to submit 3 assignments for Chingari before 10 pm and he starts to do the assignments at X pm. Each assignment takes him 1 hour to complete. Can you tell whether he'll be able to complete all assignments on time or not?

Input Format
The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer X - the time when Janmansh starts doing the assignments.
Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if he can complete the assignments on time. Otherwise, output No.

You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if((X+3)<=10):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

SAMPLE INPUT:
