DAY 9:
PROBLEM 1:
Car Trip
Chef rented a car for a day.

Usually, the cost of the car is Rs 10 per km. However, since Chef has booked the car for the whole day, he needs to pay for at least 300 kms even if the car runs less than 300 kms.

If the car ran X kms, determine the cost Chef needs to pay.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - denoting the number of kms Chef travelled.
Output Format
For each test case, output the cost Chef needs to pay.

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>300):
        print(X*10)
    else:
        print("3000")
SAMPLE INPUT:
5
800
3
299
301
300
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
8000
3000
3000
3010
3000

PROBLEM 2:
The Cooler Dilemma 2
The summer is at its peak in Chefland. Chef is planning to purchase a water cooler to keep his room cool. He has two options available:

Rent a cooler at the cost of X coins per month.
Purchase a cooler for Y coins.
Chef wonders what is the maximum number of months for which he can rent the cooler such that the cost of renting is strictly less than the cost of purchasing it.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer T â€” the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of months for which he can rent the cooler such that the cost of renting is strictly less than the cost of purchasing it.

If Chef should not rent a cooler at all, output 0.

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    M=(Y-1)//X
    print(M)
SAMPLE INPUT:
2
5 12
5 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2
0
