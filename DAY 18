DAY 18
PROBLEM 1
Reach fast
Chef is standing at coordinate A while Chefina is standing at coordinate B.

In one step, Chef can increase or decrease his coordinate by at most K.

Determine the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three integers A,B, and K, the initial coordinate of Chef, the initial coordinate of Chefina and the maximum number of coordinates Chef can move in one step.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.
SOLUTION
import math
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    A,B,K=map(int,input().split())
    distance=math.fabs(A-B)
    moves=distance/K
    print(math.ceil(moves))

PROBLEM 2
Mario and Bullet
Mario's bullet moves at 
X
X pixels per frame. He wishes to shoot a goomba standing 
Y
Y pixels away from him. The goomba does not move.

Find the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after at least 
Z
Z seconds from now.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer 
T
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,Y, and Z.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after at least Z seconds from now.

SOLUTIONS
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())
    sec=Z-(Y//X)
    if(sec<0):
        print('0')
    else:
        print(sec)
