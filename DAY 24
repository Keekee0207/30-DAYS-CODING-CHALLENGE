DAY 24
PROBLEM 1
Spice Level
Each item in Chef’s menu is assigned a spice level from 1 to 10. Based on the spice level, the item is categorised as:

MILD: If the spice level is less than 4.
MEDIUM: If the spice level is greater than equal to 4 but less than 7.
HOT: If the spice level is greater than equal to 7.
Given that the spice level of an item is X, find the category it lies in.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of an integer X — the spice level of the item.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the category that the item lies in.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, HOT, hot, Hot, and hOT are all considered the same.
SOLUTION
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		int T=in.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<T;i++)
		{
		   int X=in.nextInt();
		    if(X<4)
		    {
		        System.out.println("MILD");
		    }
		    else if(X>=4 && X<7){
		        System.out.println("MEDIUM");
		        
		    }
		    else{
		        System.out.println("HOT");
		    }
		}

	}
}
PROBLEM 2
Chef And Operators
Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators.
Relational Operators are operators which check relationship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is,

First one is greater than second or, First one is less than second or, First and second one are equal.
 

Input
First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases. Each of the T lines contain two integers A and B.

Output
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators
'<' , '>' , '='.

		    if(A>B)
		    {
		        System.out.println(">");
		    }
		    else if(A<B){
		        System.out.println("<");
		        
		    }

		    }
		}
