DAY 14
PROBLEM 1:
Bull or Bear
Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value X and sold it at value Y. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers X and Y, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold the stock respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output PROFIT if Chef made a profit on the deal, LOSS if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and NEUTRAL otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like pROfiT, profit, and PROFIT would be considered the same.

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    if((Y-X)>0):
        print('PROFIT')
    elif(Y-X==0):
        print('NEUTRAL')
    else:
        print('LOSS')
SAMPLE INPUT:

4 2
8 8
3 4
2 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
LOSS
NEUTRAL
PROFIT
LOSS

PROBLEM 2:
Reach fast
Chef is standing at coordinate 
A
A while Chefina is standing at coordinate 
B
B.

In one step, Chef can increase or decrease his coordinate by at most 
K
K.

Determine the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three integers A,B, and K, the initial coordinate of Chef, the initial coordinate of Chefina and the maximum number of coordinates Chef can move in one step.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.

CODE:
import math
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    A,B,K=map(int,input().split())
    distance=math.fabs(A-B)
    moves=distance/K
    print(math.ceil(moves))

SAMPLE INPUT:

10 20 3
36 36 5
50 4 100
30 4 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
