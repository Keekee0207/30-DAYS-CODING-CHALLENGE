DAY 23
PROBLEM 1
Audible Range
Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

If Chef's commands have a frequency of X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>=67 and X<=45000):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
PROBLEM 2
Complementary Strand in a DNA
You are given the sequence of Nucleotides of one strand of DNA through a string S of length S contains the character A,T,C, and G only.

Chef knows that:A is complementary to T is complementary to C is complementary to G is complementary to C
Using the string S, determine the sequence of the complementary strand of the DNA.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer N - denoting the length of string Second line contains N characters denoting the string S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the string containing N characters - sequence of nucleotides of the complementary strand.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    s=input()
    ans=""
    for i in s:
        if i=='A':
            ans+='T'
        if i=='T':
            ans+='A'
        if i=='C':
            ans+='G'
        if i=='G':
            ans+='C'
    print(ans)
