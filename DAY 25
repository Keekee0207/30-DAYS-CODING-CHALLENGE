DAY 25
PROBLEM 1
Reach on Time
Chef has recently moved into an apartment. It takes 30 minutes for Chef to reach office from the apartment.

Chef left for the office X minutes before Chef was supposed to reach. Determine whether or not Chef will be able to reach on time.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef will reach on time, NO otherwise.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>=30):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print('NO')
PROBLEM 2
Chef in his Office
Recently Chef joined a new company. In this company, the employees have to work for X hours each day from Monday to Thursday. Also, in this company, Friday is called Chill Day — employees only have to work for Y hours 
(Y<X) on Friday. Saturdays and Sundays are holidays.

Determine the total number of working hours in one week.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the number of working hours on each day from Monday to Thursday and the number of working hours on Friday respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the total number of working hours in one week.
SOLUTION
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    print(X*4+Y)
