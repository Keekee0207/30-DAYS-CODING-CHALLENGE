DAY 3:
PROBLEM 1:
Kitchen Timings
The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from X pm to Y(1≤X<Y≤12).

Find the number of hours Chef works.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤X<Y≤12

CODE:
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    print(Y-X)

SAMPLE INPUT:

1 2
3 7
9 11
2 10

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
4
2
8

PROBLEM 2:
Minimum Cars required
A single car can accommodate at most 4 people.
N friends want to go to a restaurant for a party. Find the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - denoting the number of friends.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1000

CODE:
import math 
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N=int(input())
    print(math.ceil(N/4))
