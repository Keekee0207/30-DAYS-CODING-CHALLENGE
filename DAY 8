DAY 8:
PROBLEM 1:
ever
Chef is not feeling well today. He measured his body temperature using a thermometer and it came out to be X °F.

A person is said to have fever if his body temperature is strictly greater than 98 °F.

Determine if Chef has fever or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer X - the body temperature of Chef in °F.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef has fever. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

CODE:
T=int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if(X>98):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
SAMPLE INPUT:
3
98
100
96

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
NO
YES
NO

PROBLEM 2:
Cyclic Quadrilateral
Read problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given the sizes of angles of a simple quadrilateral (in degrees) A,B,C,D, in some order along its perimeter. Determine whether the quadrilateral is cyclic.

Note: A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of opposite angles is 180.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integer A,B,C AND D
Output
Print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given quadrilateral is cyclic or "NO" if it is not (without quotes).

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

CODE:

T=int(input())
for  _ in range(T):
    A,B,C,D=map(int,input().split())
    if ((A+C==180) and (B+D==180)):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
SAMPLE INPUT:
3
10 20 30 300
10 20 170 160
179 1 179 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
NO
YES
NO
